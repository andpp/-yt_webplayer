# Youtube Audio Player with web interface

Youtube audio player with web-based interface.  The player can stream audion from Youtube to any audio sink using gstreamer.
For convenience it includes simple embedded audioplayer. Current track could be rewind to any position using position tracker.
Player interface supports multiple connections. However there is no user/session support so all connections will share the same session with the same playlist.

[![Main Screen](MainScreen.png  "Main Screen")](MainScreen.png  "Main Screen")

On the left panel of main window is a current playlist. On the right panel are search results. Tracks can be moved by mouse between playlist and search result or rearranged. Playlist can be saved/loaded. Most of the elements support context menu called by mouse right click. Left panel is shared beween all connected clients. 

In the main window pressing to '>>' button will switch to the next track in playlist. Left Doubleclick on any track in the playlist panel will start playing from that track.
In the search window pressing to '<<' or '>>' buttons will load previous or next page of searching results into serach results panel.

For streaming to network audio sink could stream data to [icecast](https://icecast.org/ "icecast"). However, because each Youtube track is streamed as a separate stream, streamint to icecast server will stop between tracks. APM player will stop with error is incoming audio stream will finish. To prevent this you can use ether fallback-mount option on icecast, or stream data to [LiquidSoap Audio server](https://www.liquidsoap.info/ "LiquidSoap Audio server"), which will mix a permanent network stream and send it to icecast.

Player supports playlists, searh on YouTube. Player can pull Youtube playlist and store tracks in a local playlist. 
For searching on Youtube the player requiers [Youtube API Key](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key "Youtube API Key").

Playlists are stored in a simple text format: Youtube_trackID Length - Track_Description
